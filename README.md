# -Smart-City-Traffic-Optimization

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Traffic congestion is a major issue in urban areas, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. Traditional traffic monitoring systems rely on static sensors, which may not provide real-time insights. This project aims to:

Generate synthetic traffic data simulating real-world conditions in Bangalore.
Analyze traffic patterns to identify peak congestion hours and high-traffic zones.
Predict congestion levels using machine learning to help optimize traffic flow.
Visualize traffic hotspots on an interactive map for better decision-making.


ðŸ“Š Output & Results :
Data Analysis :
Worst traffic hours (e.g., 8 AM, 6 PM).
High-congestion areas (SQL-queried hotspots).



ML Prediction:
Example: Predicts congestion for 200 cars at 25 km/h at 5 PM.
Model accuracy score (~80-90%).



Visualizations:
Bar Chart: Congestion trends by hour.
Interactive Map: Red/green markers for congestion hotspots.
